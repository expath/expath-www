      <para>The only implementations of a package manager that has been released so far is for the
            <link href="http://www.exist-db.org/">eXist database</link> and for the <link
            href="http://www.saxonica.com/">Saxon XSLT and XQuery processor</link>. Both those
         implementations are just prototypes, provided as an external application to install and
         delete packages, and based on the being-defined Packaging System module. So this module,
         and those implementations can evolve (and will do) in the near future, depending on the
         feedback got from the community.</para>
      <para>The package manager for eXist is provided as a single <link
            href="expath-pkg-exist-0.1.jar">JAR file</link>. Just download it and launch it the
         usual way (depending on your platform, that could be by double-clicking on it, or by
         executing the command <code>java -jar expath-pkg-exist-0.1.jar</code>.) For now, it
         requires a windowing system, but a text oriented interface will be provided later, to
         enable its usage on graphical-less environments, like servers. You can find a step-by-step
         presentation of this package manager in the following <link
            href="http://fgeorges.blogspot.com/2009/09/expath-packaging-system-prototype.html">blog
            post</link>.</para>
      <para>The package manager for Saxon is provided as a single <link
            href="expath-pkg-saxon-0.1.jar">JAR file</link>. If you launch it (either by
         double-clicking on it, or by executing the command <code>java -jar
            expath-pkg-saxon-0.1.jar</code>) the package manager itself starts. This is the
         graphical application which allows you to install and remove packages, and manage
         repositories. This JAR file also contains classes needed at runtime by Saxon to resolve the
         stuff installed in the repository. If you want to call Saxon from a shell window, you can
         use the following <link href="expath-pkg-saxon-0.1.sh">shell script</link> to set up
         correctly your classpath. You can find a step-by-step presentation of this package manager
         in the following <link
