      <para> Most of the extensions will be of the form of function libraries. Each module is an
         independent, consistent piece of the whole project, addressing a particular issue or
         feature area. </para>

      <details>Packaging and delivering all your X* stuff</details>
      <para>A standard packaging system for several core XML technologies, like XSLT, XQuery, XProc
         and XML Schema. Once packaged, libraries can be deployed on every supporting processor. See
         the <link href="modules/packaging/">packaging page</link>.</para>

      <title>HTTP Client</title>
      <details>Sending HTTP requests, and receiving the responses</details>
      <para>This module defines a set of functions to send HTTP requests and handle responses. This
         is a quite low-level functionality, allowing one to deal with most aspects of the HTTP
         protocol, while integrating smoothly within the <link
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/">XPath Data Model</link>. See the <link
            href="modules/http-client/">module page</link> for details.</para>

      <title>ZIP Facility</title>
      <details>Reading and writing ZIP files</details>
      <para>This module has not been released yet, but will provide a set of functions to read the
         structure of a ZIP file, read entries out of a ZIP file, update entries in an existing ZIP
         file or create brand-new files. So it will provide the ability to deal with Microsoft's
            <link href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML">Open XML</link>, OASIS's <link
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</link>, and other
         ZIP-and-XML-based document formats. Stay tuned on the <link href="lists.html">mailing
            list</link>.</para>
