      <para>XPath is great. Languages based on XPath, such as XQuery, XSLT and XProc, are great. The
         XPath recommendation provides a frame within which you can write expressions that will
         evaluate the same way in a lot of processors, written using plenty of different languages,
         in a lot of different environments, in an XML database, an in-memory processor, on a server
         or a client.</para>
      <para>This support for as many processor kinds as possible is great. But this is has been also
         a constraint to decide which feature could be included in the recommendation and which
         couldn't. In addition, experience harvested for several years of using XPath 2.0 pointed
         out missing features. This project is aimed to provide specifications for such missing
         features in a collaborative and implementation independent way, as well as delivering
         implementations of those extensions for as most processors as possible, using the
         mechanisms for extensibility provided by the XPath 2.0 recommendation itself.</para>
      <para>Other projects exist to define extensions for languages tightly bound to XPath, as the
         famous <link href="http://www.exslt.org/">EXSLT</link>, and the more recent <link
            href="http://www.exquery.org/">EXQuery</link> and <link href="http://www.exproc.org/"
            >EXProc</link> projects. We think that those projects are really useful and fill a gap
         in the XML core technologies landscape. But we think also they should not reinvent their
         own wheels, when working at the XPath level (when that makes sense) would permit to share
         common work. This is just following the brilliant idea of XSLT and XQuery working groups at
         the W3C which joined their efforts in defining together XPath 2.0: far from competing with
         those projects, the idea is to promote collaboration between them.</para>

      <title>Standard function libraries</title>
      <para>The easiest way to provide new features to XPath is to define extension functions. We
         plan to provide several function libraries that each addresses a specific area. For
         instance performing HTTP requests, using <link href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV"
            >WebDAV</link>, reading and writing ZIP files (like <link
            href="http://www.openebook.org/">EPUB</link> eBook, <link
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML">Open XML</link> and <link
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</link> files,) parsing and
         serializing XML and HTML documents, executing XSLT transforms and XQuery queries,
         etcetera.</para>
      <para>Have a look at the <link href="modules.html">Modules</link> section for available and
         work-in-progress function libraries.</para>
   </primary>

      <title>Extensions to the language</title>
      <para>Besides function libraries, we want to address more fundamental XPath issues as well,
         right at the language level. One obvious example is nested sequences. XPath 2.0 does not
         provide any way to nest sequences. One can build complex data structures by using XML
         trees, but then he has to copy the data to that tree, he cannot have complex data structure
         that preserves all properties of the initial items and nodes.</para>
      <para>While this can be defined and implemented through extension functions, this is a typical
         example of more fundamental changes that require more than a function API documentation to
         be used.</para>
      <para>Those extensions are a good place to experiment with new ideas to improve the current
         version of XPath.</para>

      <title>XPath usage contexts</title>
      <para>XPath is a language used embedded in many other languages, as XSLT, XQuery, Java, C#,
         Perl, Python... But it is also used in different contexts: in a standalone XSLT transform,
         as part of an XQuery on an XML Database, in a server environment, in a system performing
         XML streaming or an in-memory-tree-based system.</para>
      <para>All those different environments have their own particularities. It would be interesting
         for instance to define how one can access the HTTP request context info on a web server
         (getting header values, setting response Content-Type, etc.)</para>
      <para>Like the Java Servlet specification does not only define a set of classes and methods,
         we should here define how the container must behave, what information it must provide and
         how it must react to some XPath expression evaluation.</para>

      <para>This is simple. Read through this website, and <link href="lists.html">join the
            list</link>. You can help by providing use cases, writing specifications, implement
         them, or simply by using existing extensions.</para>

      <title>The process</title>
      <para>From experience with other similar projects, defining extensions is a domain where
         people have a lot of very useful, interesting ideas. But having fun ideas, or even a
         coarse-grained idea of what the function prototypes and the specification should look like
         is just the top of the iceberg. The real work starts here...</para>
      <para>We maintain a list of raw ideas, and we are highly interested in getting your own ideas,
         use case, and how extensions, existing or not, can be used to help you solving your
         problems.</para>
      <para>But the whole point of this project is to be pragmatic and to provide concrete
         extensions, ready to be used and well-defined. Sounds rational, isn't it? And the best way
         to help us to help you is to take part in the process. Communicate, send your own use
         cases, send prototype implementations, write a draft for a specification, report
         bugs...</para>
      <para>The central point of the process is to communicate through the mailing list. So <link
            href="lists.html">join the list</link>, follow the discussions and see how you could
         help.</para>
