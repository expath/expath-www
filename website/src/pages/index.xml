      <para>XPath is great. XPath-based languages like XQuery, XSLT, and XProc, are great. The XPath
         recommendation provides a foundation for writing expressions that evaluate the same way in
         a lot of processors, written in different languages, running in different environments, in
         XML databases, in in-memory processors, in servers or in clients.</para>
      <para>Supporting so many different kinds of processor is wonderful thing. But this also
         contrains which features are feasible at the XPath level and which are not. In the years
         since the release of XPath 2.0, experience has gradually revealed some missing features.</para>
      <para>EXPath exists to provide specifications for such missing features in a collaborative-
         and implementation-independent way. EXPath also provides facilities to help and deliver
         implementations to as many processors as possible, via extensibility mechanisms from the
         XPath 2.0 Recommendation itself.</para>
      <para>Other projects exist to define extensions for XPath-based languages or languages using
         XPath, as the famous <link href="http://www.exslt.org/">EXSLT</link>, and the more recent
            <link href="http://www.exquery.org/">EXQuery</link> and <link
            href="http://www.exproc.org/">EXProc</link> projects. We think that those projects are
         really useful and fill a gap in the XML core technologies landscape. Nevertheless, working
         at the XPath level allows common solutions when there is no sense in reinventing the wheel
         over and over again. This is just following the brilliant idea of the W3C’s XSLT and XQuery
         working groups, which joined forces to define XPath 2.0 together. EXPath purpose is not to
         compete with other projects, but collaborate with them.</para>

      <title>Standard function libraries</title>
      <para>The easiest way to improve XPath is by defining extension functions. We plan to provide
         several function libraries. Each library focuses on a specific area. For instance
         performing HTTP requests, using <link href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV"
            >WebDAV</link>, reading and writing ZIP files (like <link
            href="http://www.openebook.org/">EPUB</link> eBooks, <link
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML">Open XML</link> and <link
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</link> files,) parsing and
         serializing XML and HTML documents, executing XSLT transforms and XQuery queries,
         etcetera.</para>
      <para>Check the <link href="modules">Modules</link> section for function libraries (some are
         available and some are still work-in-progress).</para>

      <title>Packaging System</title>
      <para>An important contribution to the XML community is the EXPath Packaging System. The goal
         is to be able to package any set of XML Core Technology files in a single archive, with
         enough information to be installed by a processor. You can for instance use it to deliver
         an XSLT library of stylesheets for transforming DocBook to HTML, or XQuery files providing
         support for Google REST Web services. Of course, packaging extension functions (written in
         a processor-dependent language) is also supported.</para>
      <para>Several processors implements the Packaging System, either natively or through
         third-party, open source implementations (for now: BaseX, Calabash, eXist, Qizx and Saxon).
         The packaging format supports XSLT, XQuery, XProc, XML Schema and various DSDL
         technologies, and is extensible (e.g. to support native language extensions). See the <link
            href="modules/pkg/">Packaging System</link> homepage for further details.</para>

      <title>Extensions to the language</title>
      <para>Besides function libraries, we want to address more fundamental XPath issues as well,
         right at the language level. One obvious example is nested sequences. XPath 2.0 does not
         provide any way to nest sequences. One can build complex data structures by using XML
         trees, but then he has to copy the data to that tree, he cannot have complex data structure
         that preserves all properties of the initial items and nodes.</para>
      <para>While this can be defined and implemented through extension functions, this is a typical
         example of more fundamental changes that require more than a function API documentation to
         be used.</para>
      <para>Those extensions are a good place to experiment with new ideas to improve the current
         version of XPath.</para>

      <title>XPath usage contexts</title>
      <para>XPath is embedded in many other languages: XSLT, XQuery, Java, C#, Perl, and Python, to
         name a few. But it is also used in different contexts: standalone XSLT transforms, as part
         of an XQuery on an XML Database, in server environments, in XML streaming systems as well
         as in in-memory-tree-based systems.</para>
      <para>All of these different contexts have their own peculiarities. It would be interesting
         for instance to define how one can access the HTTP request context info on a web server (to
         get header values, set the Content-Type for the response, and so on).</para>
      <para>Just as the Java Servlet specification does not only offer a bunch of classes and
         methods, we should here define how the container must behave, what information it must
         provide and how it must react to XPath expression. The <link href="modules/webapp/">Webapp
            Module</link> defines such a web container.</para>

         them, or simply using existing extensions are all great ways to help.</para>

      <title>The process</title>
      <para>From experience on other similar projects, defining extensions is a domain where
         people have a lot of very useful, interesting ideas. But having fun ideas, or even a
         coarse-grained idea of what the function prototypes and the specification should look like
         is just the top of the iceberg. The real work starts here...</para>
      <para>We maintain a list of raw ideas. We would love to get your own ideas, use cases, and
         feedback about existing extensions. How an extension helped or failed to help are both
         valuable kinds if feedback.</para>
      <para>But this project is all about providing pragmatic, concrete extensions: well-defined,
         and ready to be used. Sounds rational, doesn’t it? And the best way to help us to help you is
         to take part in the process. Communicate, send your own use cases, send prototype
         implementations, write a draft for a specification, report bugs...</para>
      <para>The project centers around discussions on the mailing list. <link href="lists">Join the
            list</link> and tell us what you think and how you would like to help!</para>
