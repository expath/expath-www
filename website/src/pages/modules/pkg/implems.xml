      <para>So far, three processors implement the current state of the packaging proposal.  The
         <link href="http://www.exist-db.org/">eXist</link> database, the
         <link href="http://www.saxonica.com/">Saxon</link> XSLT and XQuery processor and the
         <link href="http://xmlcalabash.com/">Calabash</link> XProc processor.  The support in
         eXist is official (part of the current eXist trunk, which should be released as eXist 1.6
         in the last quarter of 2010).  The support in Saxon and Calabash as been implemented as a
         third-party project; see the <link href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/">project
         home</link> for all details and downloads.</para>
      <para>All those three implementations rely on the same underlying repository structure, and
         actually all use the same repository manager written in Java as part of the above mentioned
         <link href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/">expath-pkg project</link>.  They also all
         support packaging extension functions written in Java (for Saxon and eXist, but Calabash
         can configure its underlying Saxon processor as well).</para>
      <para>The <link href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/">expath-pkg project</link> also
         provides a repository manager, called <code>xrepo</code>, to help managing packages in
         a repository (installing, removing, listing, etc.)  The same implementations are also used
         in <link href="http://code.google.com/p/servlex/">Servlex</link>, the framework used to
         run the EXPath website, based exclusively on XML technologies.</para>
