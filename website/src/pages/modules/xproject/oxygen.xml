      <para>The XProject plugin for oXygen can be found <link
            href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/downloads/list">here</link> (downoad the
         latest file named <code>xproject-oxygen-plugin-*.zip</code>). Unzip the archive in your
         oXygen install directory, in its subdir <code>plugins</code>. This must result in a subdir
            <code>[oxygen]/plugins/xproject/</code>. For instance on Mac OS X, this will typically
         result in creating the new directory
            <code>/Applications/oxygen-13.2/plugins/xproject/</code>.</para>
      <para>The next time you start oXygen, you will have 4 more buttons in the toolbar, named
            <emph>Build</emph>, <emph>Test</emph>, <emph>Doc</emph> and <emph>Release</emph>. While
         editing any file within your project directory, you can click one of those buttons to
         execute the corresponding XProject target.</para>
      <para><emph>Build</emph> creates a new package in <code>dist/</code> based on
            <code>src/</code>. <emph>Test</emph> run the XSpec tests in test/ and place the reports
         in the same dir (see the sample project in the ZIP to see how to configure your processors
         and XML databases to run the tests), <emph>Doc</emph> places the XQuery documentation in
            <code>dist/xqdoc/</code>, and <emph>Release</emph> creates a new delivery file in
            <code>dist/</code>.</para>
      <para>The packages created by <emph>Build</emph> can be installed automatically in any EXPath
         <link href="../pkg/">Packaging System</link>-compliant system.</para>
      <para>Any feedback, help, request for improvement is welcome! Please use the EXPath <link
