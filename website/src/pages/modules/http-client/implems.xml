      <para>For now, there are four implementations: for <link href="http://www.saxonica.com/"
            >Saxon</link> (XSLT 2.0 and XQuery,) for <link href="http://www.zorba-xquery.com/"
            >Zorba</link>, for <link href="http://www.exist-db.org/">eXist</link>, and for <link
            href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic Server</link>. The later two are partial
         implementations though, as they rely on the similar, product-dependent extension of these
         products, which do not permit to provide the whole functionality. Anyone is welcome to
         contribute of course, see the <link href="../../lists">mailing list</link>. Some work are
         undergoing to provide better support of the EXPath HTTP Client on those processors.</para>
      <para>The implementation for Zorba is a built-in implementation. All other implementations are
         hosted in the <link href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-http-client/"
            >expath-http-client</link> project. The implementation for Saxon has been released as an
         XAR package. The implementation for eXist is part of the official eXist release (you can
         use it out of the box). The implementation for MarkLogic has not been released yet, as it
         is only partial, but you can find it in the <link
            href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-http-client/source/browse/trunk/marklogic/http-client.xq"
            >subversion repository</link>.</para>
