      <para>For now, there are five implementations: for <link href="http://www.saxonica.com/"
            >Saxon</link> (XSLT 2.0 and XQuery,) for <link href="http://www.zorba-xquery.com/"
            >Zorba</link>, for <link href="http://www.exist-db.org/">eXist</link>, for <link
            href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic Server</link>, for <link
            href="http://basex.org/">BaseX</link>, and for the .NET framework.</para>
      <para>The implementation
         for MarkLogic is a partial implementations though, as it relies on the similar,
         product-dependent extension of this product, which does not permit to provide the whole
         functionality. Anyone is welcome to contribute of course, see the
            <link href="../../lists">mailing list</link>. Some work are undergoing to provide
         better support of the EXPath HTTP Client on this processor.</para>
      <para>The implementations for Zorba, eXist and BaseX are built-in implementations.
         All other implementations are
         hosted in the <link href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-http-client/"
            >expath-http-client</link> project. The implementation for Saxon has been released as an
         XAR package. The implementation for eXist is part of the official eXist release (you can
         use it out of the box). The implementation for MarkLogic has not been released yet, as it
         is only partial, but you can find it in the <link
            href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-http-client/source/browse/trunk/marklogic/http-client.xq"
            >subversion repository</link>.</para>
      <para><link href="http://myxsl.net">myxsl.net</link>, a framework to build website with XML
         technologies, provides with an implementation of the HTTP Client for .NET.  Several
         XSLT/XQuery processors are supported, including .NET and Saxon.  See this
            <link href="http://myxsl.net/expath/http-client/">page</link>.</para>
