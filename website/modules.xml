      <para> Most of the extensions will be of the form of function libraries. Each module is an
         independent, consistent piece of the whole project, addressing a particular issue or
         feature area. </para>

      <details>Sending HTTP requests</details>
      <para>This is the first module defined so far. It has not been adapted to the work-in-progress
         EXPath formalism yet, but is available on its <link href="http://www.fgeorges.org/exslt2/"
            >legacy page</link> for now. Any thought about how it should be released as part of
         EXPath would be much appreciated on the <link href="lists.xml">mailing list</link>.</para>
