         XPath is great. Languages based on XPath, as XQuery and XSLT, are great. The
         XPath recommendation provides a frame within which you can write expressions
         that will evaluate the same way in a lot of processors, written using plenty of
         different languages, in a lot of different environments, in an XML database, an
         in-memory processor, on a server or a client.

         This support for as many processor kinds as possible is great.  But this is has
         been also a constraint to decide which feature could be included in the
         recommendation and which couldn't.  In addition, experience harvested for many
         years of using XPath 2.0 pointed out missing features.  This project is aimed to
         provide specifications for such missing features in a collaborative and
         implementation independent way, as well as delivering implementations of those
         extensions for as most processors as possible, using the mechanisms for extensibility
         provided by the XPath 2.0 recommendation.
