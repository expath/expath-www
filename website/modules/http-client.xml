      <title>HTTP Client</title>
      <para>This module defines a set of functions to send HTTP requests and handle responses. This
         is a quite low-level functionality, allowing one to deal with most aspects of the HTTP
         protocol (redirections, headers, body contents...), while integrating smoothly within the
            <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/">XPath Data Model</link>.</para>
      <para>This module was written initially for EXSLT 2.0, but it is really an XPath extension,
         that makes sense to be used in XQuery as well, for instance. It is being moved to EXPath,
         but the <link href="http://www.fgeorges.org/exslt2/">legacy page</link> is still
         available.</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Besides the <link href="http-client/http-client.xml">specification</link>, here is a
         formal introduction to the module. It defines a single function,
            <code>http:send-request()</code> (with several arities for the sake of ease of use.) It
         takes a description of the request in parameter, and returns a representation of the
         response</para>
