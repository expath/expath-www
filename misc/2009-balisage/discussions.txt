Here are useful points I'd like to discuss with some attendees.

*** Jenni

 - How would it be possible to use XSpec to test really XPath
   functions?  Without depending on being within XSLT?  And XQuery?

*** Norm

 - Issue with his resolver (under Windows...)

*** Mike, Wolfgang, Daniela, Norm, other X* implementers

 - Discuss the Packaging System.  How could it best integrate with
   their processors?  Are they interested in supporting it?

 - In particular during the MarkLogic event...

*** MarkLogic guys

 - How to develop an extension function? (for instance in Java)

*** E* projects members

 - Discuss some ideas in front of a beer, some evening?
