Here are useful points I'd like to discuss with some attendees.

* Jenni

- How would it be possible to use XSpec to test really XPath
  functions?  Without depending on being within XSLT?  And XQuery?

* Mike, Wolfgang, Daniela, Norm, other X* implementers

- Discuss the Packaging System.  How could it best integrate with
  their processors?  Are they interested in supporting it?

* E* projects members

- Discuss some ideas in front of a beer, some evening?
