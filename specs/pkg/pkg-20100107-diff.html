<h2><a name="abstract" id="abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This proposal defines a packaging system for various core XML technologies: XSLT,
            XQuery, and XProc. The goal is to define it in a way enough generic so to adapt it to
            other technologies in the future (such as XML Schema, XForms, etc.) using the same
            framework. Besides enabling the delivery of libraries written in standard XSLT, XQuery
            and XProc, it provides support for extensions specific to some processors, as well as
            enabling new processors to be supported by using the same framework.</p></div><div class="toc">

<h2><a name="d3e61" id="d3e61"></a>1 Introduction</h2><p>XSLT, XQuery and XProc are amazing programming languages. But they lack a large choice
            of libraries, and when such libraries do exist, this is a challenge to install. There is
            no automatic install process, the rules are different for each processor, library
            authors do not follow the same rules regarding the info they provide, the cataloging,
            the way they reference third-party libraries, etc.</p><p>All those problems (well, most of them) can be addressed by a packaging system that
            would be broadly adopted by processor vendors and library authors. The cornerstone of
            such a system is the packaging format: a description of the information to be provided
            by the library authors and how to provide and structure them.</p></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="d3e68" id="d3e68"></a>2 Concepts</h2><div class="diff-add"><p>A <b>package</b> is a set of files fulfilling a common purpose. A package
            could for instance provide XML schemas for a particular document type, alongside a set
            of XSLT stylesheets to format the same document type to HTML or XSL-FO. Or a package can
            simply provide an XQuery library module containing a set of functions (directly
            supporting the notion of <em>library</em>). Those files composing a package
            (stylesheets, schemas, pipelines, queries, etc.) are called its <b>components</b>.</p></div><div class="diff-add"><p>A package has a unique name (a URI) as well as a convenient short name, also
            known as its <b>abbrev</b> (an NCName), used in contexts where a URI is not suitable
            (or simply not convenient) and where the uniqueness of the name is not necessary. A
            package has a set of dependencies too. A dependency is another package, identified by
            its full name, a package depends on. [[ TODO: Introduce other kinds of dependencies, for
            instance collections... ? ]]</p></div><div class="diff-add"><p>A package provides all those infos as well as its components as a single
            file. This is then very convenient to organize packages, publish them, give them to a
            processor to install them, etc.</p></div><div class="diff-add"><p>A <b>component</b> can be of one out of several types: an XSLT stylesheet,
            an XML schema, a RELAX NG schema, an XProc pipeline, but also any other type a
            particular implementation chose to support. Its is identified by a <b>public URI</b>.
            This public URI is used to access the component from the outside of the package. Each
            component type has its own <b>URI space</b>, within which a component's URI has to be
            unique (so two different components can have the same public URI if they are of
            different types, but this is not recommended).</p></div><div class="diff-add"><p>All the components composing the package, alongside an additional <b>package
               descriptor</b>, are used to create a ZIP file. This file <em>is</em> the
            physical package, and can be used to distribute the package to the users. The package
            descriptor is a plain XML file, named <code>expath-pkg.xml</code> at the root of the ZIP
            file, and containing information about the package (like its name and its version
            number) and about the components it provides and how to reference them.</p></div><div class="diff-del"><p>A library is a set of files fulfilling a common purpose. An XSLT library can
            for instance provide a set of template rules and functions to help formating a
            particular XML document type. A package is a way to bundle those files into a single ZIP
            file, following a defined structure and providing more information within the
               <b>package descriptor</b>. The package descriptor is a plain XML file, named
               <code>expath-pkg.xml</code> at the root of the ZIP file, and containing information
            about the library (like its name and its version number) and about the files it provides
            and how to reference them (for instance stylesheets and query modules.)</p></div><div class="diff-del"><p>The ZIP file structure (aka the package structure) must have exactly two
            entries at the top level: the package descriptor and one directory entry. This directory
            contains all the library files, and all file references in the package descriptor are
            relative to this directory. This directory is called the <b>library directory</b>.</p></div><div class="diff-del"><p>All the elements in the package descriptor are defined in the namespace
               <code>http://expath.org/mod/expath-pkg</code>. All the elements defined in this
            specification or used in samples and in text are in this namespace, even if no prefix is
            used. The root element is <code>package</code>, and contains exactly one child element
               <code>module</code>:</p></div><div class="diff-del"><div class="exampleInner"><pre class="diff-del">
&lt;package&gt;
   module
&lt;/package&gt;

&lt;module name = NCName
        version = string&gt;
   title,
   (xslt
   |xquery
   |xproc
   |xsd
   |rng
   |rnc
   |...)+
&lt;/module&gt;</pre></div></div><div class="diff-del"><p><code>name</code> is the library name. The top-level directory in the package
            structure must have the exact same name. The module has also a version number, and a
            human-readable title. It then provides information about one or several files. Those
            files are called the <b>components</b>. In addition to those standard file
            descriptors, it can also contain elements specific to some processors (for instance an
            element for Saxon, eXist, etc.) Details are provided below.</p></div><div class="diff-del"><p>The components are the files <em>exported</em> by the module. But the
            whole library directory must be preserved. Indeed, it can contain other, private files,
            aimed to be used only from within library files, not from the outside.</p></div><div class="diff-del"><p>The components are accessed from the outside of the package by using a URI.
            This URI is the <b>public URI</b>, and absolute URI, which cannot be of scheme
               <code>file:</code>. Its exact usage depends on the kind of component (for instance,
            with XSLT it is aimed at be used in xsl:import, and in XQuery this is the target
            namespace of an XQuery library module.) Each kind of component defines its own <b>URI
               space</b>. So to uniquely identify a component in the repository, one needs the
            public URI and the URI space to use.</p></div></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="d3e161" id="d3e161"></a>3 Package descriptor</h2><div class="diff-add"><p>The package descriptor is an XML file, named <code>expath-pkg.xml</code> and
            located at the root of the ZIP file. It describe the whole package, and all of its
            components. Alongside this descriptor, the root of the ZIP file contains a directory
            named after the module name (see below) which contains the components and any other file
            the package needs. All the relative URIs used to identify components are relative to the
            package directory.</p></div><div class="diff-add"><div class="note"><p class="prefix"><b>Note:</b></p><p>Because this package format is designed to be extensible and used as a building block
               by other specifications, the ZIP file can contain another entries at top-level. They
               are just ignored when the package is deployed as a simple package following this
               specification.</p></div></div><div class="diff-add"><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d3e172" id="d3e172"></a>3.1 Overall structure</h3><p>All the elements in the package descriptor are defined in the namespace
                  <code>http://expath.org/ns/pkg</code>. All the elements defined in this
               specification or used in samples and in text are in this namespace, even if no prefix
               is used. The root element is <code>package</code>, and contains a name, an optional
               list of dependencies to other packages, and exactly one child element
                  <code>module</code>:</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
&lt;package name = uri&gt;
   dependency*,
   module
&lt;/package&gt;

&lt;dependency name = uri&gt;
   <em>empty</em>
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre></div><p><code>name</code> is the name of the package. A package is named using an absolute
               URI, except any <code>file:</code> scheme URIs (most frequent choices are
                  <code>http:</code> and <code>urn:</code> scheme URIs). Dependencies are set by
               using the name of other packages this package depends on. The <code>module</code>
               content model is:</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
&lt;module name = NCName
        version = string&gt;
   title,
   (xslt
   |xquery
   |xproc
   |xsd
   |rng
   |rnc
   |...)+
&lt;/module&gt;</pre></div><p><code>name</code> is a short module name. The package directory must have the exact
               same name. The module has also a version number, and a human-readable title. It then
               provides information about one or several components. In addition to those standard
               components, it can also contain elements specific to some processors (for instance an
               element for Saxon, eXist, etc.)</p><p>The following is the description of the standard component kinds supported by this
               specification, and how they contribute to the package descriptor document type.</p></div></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d3e215" id="d3e215"></a>3.2 XSLT</h3><p>An XSLT file is associated a <em>public import URI</em>.This is the URI to use in
               an XSLT import instruction (aka <code>xsl:import</code>) to import the XSLT file
               provided in the package. This file is configured with the element
               <code>xslt</code>.</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
&lt;xslt&gt;
   import-uri,
   file
&lt;/xslt&gt;</pre></div><p>The element <code>file</code> contains the path to the file within the package
               structure, relative to the <span class="diff-chg"><span>package</span></span> directory. Both
               elements <code>import-uri</code> and <code>file</code> are of type
                  <code>anyURI</code>.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d3e248" id="d3e248"></a>3.3 XQuery</h3><p>An XQuery library module is referenced by its namespace URI. Thus the
                  <code>xquery</code> element associates a namespace URI to an XQuery file. An
               importing module just need to use an import statement of the form <code>import module
                  namespace xx = "&lt;namespace-uri&gt;";</code>.</p><div class="diff-add"><p>An XQuery main module is associated a public URI. Usually an XQuery
               package will provide functions through library modules, but in some cases one can
               want to provide main modules as well.</p></div><div class="diff-add"><div class="exampleInner"><pre class="diff-add">
&lt;xquery&gt;

&lt;xquery&gt;
   namespace,
   file
&lt;/xquery&gt;</pre></div></div><p>Note that there is no way to set any location hint (as the <code>at</code> clause in
               the import statement.) To use this packaging system, an XQuery library module must be
               referenced by its target namespace.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d3e270" id="d3e270"></a>3.4 XProc</h3><p>An XProc pipeline, like an XSLT stylesheet, is associated a <em>public import
                  URI</em>, aimed to be used in an XProc <code>p:import</code> statement.</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>

<h3><a name="d3e283" id="d3e283"></a>3.5 XML Schema</h3><p>An XML schema can be imported using its target namespace. Like for XQuery, there is
               no way to use any <code>schemaLocation</code> instead. There is neither the ability
               to set several files as several sources for the schema. If the schema is spread over
               multiple files, there must be one top-level file that includes the other files.</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>

               good idea in a packaging system...) (TODO: This does not support
                  <code>xs:redefine</code>, as it requires a hint, not a target namespace)</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d3e298" id="d3e298"></a>3.6 RelaxNG</h3><p>A RelaxNG schema, like an XSLT stylesheet, is associated a public import URI, aimed
               to be used in an <em>import</em> statement (either the <em>include</em>
               element for an RNG schema or an <em>import</em> directive for an RNC schema.)</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>

<h3><a name="d3e329" id="d3e329"></a>3.9 Not supported file kinds</h3><p>Documentation (like result of XSLStyle or xqDoc) is not taken into account in the
               packaging format, though that could be used by IDEs for instance to provide
               documentation for functions in an editor with a live completion feature. Some support
               for documentation can of course be added as a product-specific feature to the package
               descriptor.</p></div></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="d3e334" id="d3e334"></a>4 Processor behaviour</h2><p>A <b>processor</b> is any program that use packaged components. For instance, an XSLT
            processor uses XSLT stylesheets (as well as XML schemas for an XSLT 2.0 SA processor),
            an XML database can use XQuery modules, XSLT stylesheets or any other kind of component,
            etc. But processors include also IDEs, editors, and any program that could want to use
            packaged components and that supports this specification.</p><p>The installed package list is implementation-defined. Each implementation (for a
            specific processor) can define its own way to install and remove packages, as long as it
            properly documents it. A processor should use, when appropriate, the <b>on-disk
               repository layout</b> as defined below.</p><div class="diff-add"><p>Whether or not such a repository exists (or several repositories), the
            implementation must define an installed packages list. How this is done is outside the
            scope of this spec. An XML IDE could provide a way to select packages to activate for a
            specific scenario, or a web server container could activate packages on a per-web
            application basis.</p></div><p>When a reference to a file of a specific kind is done via an absolute URI, a processor
            must look up for this URI in the corresponding URI space in the repository. How the
            repository is set to the processor is implementation-defined (a processor can also use a
            list of repositories, and enable or disable some libraries in any implementation-defined
            way.)</p><p>The URI space to use is defined by the nature of the reference. An XSLT
               <code>href</code> attribute on <code>xsl:import</code> will use the <code>xslt</code>
            URI space, while it will use the <code>xsd</code> space for
               <code>xsl:import-schema</code>.</p><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d3e368" id="d3e368"></a>4.1 XProc pipelines</h3><p>An XProc processor in particular has to pay great attention to the space it use
               regarding the step that is beng evaluated. Any <code>xsl:import</code> instruction
               encountered on the <code>stylesheet</code> port of the step <code>p:xslt</code> has
               to be looked for in the <code>xslt</code> space (regardless if the stylesheet
               document is inlined in the pipeline, computed, loaded from the file system or
               retrieved from the Internet, or if the containing stylesheet has been imported
               itself.)</p><p>The XProc elements <code>p:document</code> and <code>p:data</code>, as well as the
               step <code>p:load</code> are handled specially. They can be used to access any kind
               of resource, including but not limited to components in a repository. The user has to
               tell explicitely the processor what kind of component is looked for by using the
                  <code>pkg:kind</code> extension attribute. For instance, a stylesheet can be
               loaded from a repository as input to the step <code>xslt</code> as following:</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
&lt;p:xslt&gt;
   &lt;p:input port="stylesheet"&gt;
      &lt;p:document href="..." pkg:kind="xslt"/&gt;

<h2><a name="d3e404" id="d3e404"></a>5 On-disk repository layout</h2><p>This section defines a standard structure for on-disk repositories. An implementation
            can choose to not support this kind of repository and to define its own one (or even to
            not define it publicly, just to provide the ability to install and remove packages, in a
            clearly documented way.) However, there are several advantages to support this
            structure, the most obvious one is to be able to benefit from existing tools to manage
            such repositories as well as existing libraries to access those repositories.</p><p>The resolving machinery is based on OASIS XML Catalogs <a href="#catalogs">[Catalogs]</a>. The
            repository is a simple directory, each subdirectory of which is an installed package
            (aka a <b>package dir</b>.) The only exception to this is the subdirectory
               <code>.expath-pkg/</code> which is dedicated to store working information about the
            installed packages, among which the catalogs (aka the <b>admin dir</b>.)</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
[repository-dir]/
   .expath-pkg/
      xquery-catalog.xml
      xslt-catalog.xml
      lib1/
         xquery-catalog.xml
         xslt-catalog.xml
      lib2/
         ...
   lib1/
      query.xq
      style.xsl
   lib2/
      ...</pre></div><p>The <em>package dirs</em> are really simple: they are simply an unzipped version of
            the XAR file. The name of the directory is simply the same as the name of the module in
            the package. The <em>admin dir</em> contains a catalog for each URI space (the
            catalog for one specific URI space can not be there if there is no one file in that URI
            space in the whole repository.) The name of such a catalog is
               <code>[space]-catalog.xml</code> where [space] is either <code>xslt</code>,
               <code>xquery</code>, <code>rnc</code>, etc. Those catalogs are called <b>repository
               catalogs</b>. It also contains a subdirectory for each installed package, with the
            same naming convention. In turn, those directories contain catalog files, containing the
            mappings defined in the corresponding package descriptors (pointing to the actual files
            installed in the <em>package dirs</em>.) Those are called the <b>package
               catalogs</b>. They follow the same naming convention than the <em>repository
               catalogs</em> (divided by URI spaces.) The repository catalogs just include the
            several package catalogs for the same URI space.</p><p>[ ... TODO ... ]</p></div><div class="diff-add"><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="d3e459" id="d3e459"></a>6 Example</h2><p>This section provides a non-normative example to illustrate the concepts defined here.
            Instead of using a <em>hello world</em> example, it describes the packaging of the
            existing FunctX library <a href="#functx">[FunctX]</a>. This library consists of a standard
            XQuery 1.0 library module and a standard XSLT 2.0 stylesheet (both provide the same set
            of functions to either XQuery or XSLT, but this is not relevant to packaging.)</p><p>The first thing to do is to create a ZIP file with both of those components, alongside a
               <em>package descriptor</em>. The constraints are: 1/ the package descriptor is
            named <code>expath-pkg.xml</code> at the root of the package, 2/ the library content is
            in a directory at the root of the package (aka the <em>package directory</em>), and
            3/ the name of this directory must be the value of the name attribute of the
               <code>module</code> element, and must be a valid NCName. The structure (the content)
            of the package directory is completely free. In our case, let's just put both component
            files directly in the package directory, and define the module name as
               <code>functx</code>:</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
expath-pkg.xml
functx/
   functx.xql
   functx.xsl</pre></div><p>The XQuery library module's target namespace is defined by the module itself. For the
            XSLT stylesheet, we have to define its <em>public URI</em>, used to identify it
            within an <code>xsl:import</code> (or any other means, for instance within XProc or an
            IDE scenarii system). Let's define it as <code>http://www.functx.com/functx.xsl</code>.
            The package descriptor thus looks like the following:</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
&lt;package xmlns="http://expath.org/ns/pkg"&gt;
   &lt;module name="functx" version="1.0"&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;FunctX library&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;xquery&gt;
         &lt;namespace&gt;http://www.functx.com&lt;/namespace&gt;
         &lt;file&gt;functx.xql&lt;/file&gt;
      &lt;/xquery&gt;
      &lt;xslt&gt;
         &lt;import-uri&gt;http://www.functx.com/functx.xsl&lt;/import-uri&gt;
         &lt;file&gt;functx.xsl&lt;/file&gt;
      &lt;/xslt&gt;
   &lt;/module&gt;
&lt;/package&gt;</pre></div><p>We just have to create a ZIP file with this structure and content. The convention is to
            call this file <code>functx-1.0.xar</code> (that is,
               [<em>name</em>]-[<em>version</em>].xar). That's all for the package
            itself.</p><p>If the target processor supports the on-disk repository layout, here is what the
            repository could look like after the package has been installed:</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
[repository-dir]/
   .expath-pkg/
      xquery-catalog.xml
      xslt-catalog.xml
      functx/
         xquery-catalog.xml
         xslt-catalog.xml
   functx/
      functx.xql
      functx.xsl</pre></div><p>The package directory has been copied verbatim, and two new catalogs have been created
            for the package, pointing to the components in the package directory. The top-level
            catalogs in the admin directory (one per URI space) just point to the other
            package-specific catalogs. Here is for instance the content of
               <code>.expath-pkg/xslt-catalog.xml</code>, initiating the catalog list for the URI
            space for XSLT (in our case the catalog for the URI space for XSLT of the single
            installed package):</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
&lt;catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog"&gt;
   &lt;nextCatalog catalog="functx/xslt-catalog.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/catalog&gt;</pre></div><p>The catalogs at the package-level point to the actual components by using a relative
            path within the repository. The following is for example the content of the catalog
               <code>.expath-pkg/functx/xslt-catalog.xml</code>:</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
&lt;catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog"&gt;
   &lt;!-- TODO: Should there be a system entry as well? --&gt;
   &lt;uri name="http://www.functx.com/functx.xsl"
        uri="../../functx/functx.xsl"/&gt;
&lt;/catalog&gt;</pre></div><p>A user can then import the FunctX library from either an XQuery module or an XSLT
            stylesheet by using respectively an import statement:</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
import module namespace fx = "http://www.functx.com/";</pre></div><p>or an import instruction:</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>
&lt;xsl:import href="http://www.functx.com/functx.xsl"/&gt;</pre></div></div></div><div class="diff-add"><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="d3e540" id="d3e540"></a>7 Extensibility</h2><p>The package format defined in this specification is a complete system to package
            libraries, for the right definition of a library. But a specfic kind of
               <em>library</em> can require more information. For instance, a web application is
            also a set of components, but requiring more configuration. An additional descriptor
            format for such applications could be defined and added to this packaging framework to
            define a specialized kind of packages. By building upon this packaging format, the new
            format would benefit from the existing mechanism to map public URIs to components.</p><p>Another extensibility point is the definition of additional component types. The
            component types defined here are the standard types, but an implementation may support
            additional implementation-defined types.</p><p>More generally, an implementation may define any extension element in the package
            descriptor to achieve its purposes, providing that the new elements it defines are
            neither in the EXPath Packaging namespace nor in the null namespace.</p></div></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="d3e552" id="d3e552"></a>8 Editorial notes</h2><ul><li><p>Should the package system define a set of XPath functions? Instead of just
                  defining the package format and letting everything else as implementation-defined,
